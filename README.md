Topic :-Parallel-K-means-Clustering
Objective:-
Parallel implementation of K-means Clustering algorithm using OpenMp in C++
 
 
INTRODUCTION:-
The K-means algorithm is a method for dividing a dataset into K clusters, with each data point belonging to only one cluster. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points within a cluster, resulting in clusters that are more homogenous and have less variation. The algorithm works by iteratively reassigning data points to different clusters until the sum of squared distances is minimized.
